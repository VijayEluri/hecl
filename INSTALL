		      Getting Started with Hecl
		      =========================

How to compile and run simple Hecl programs.

1) Hecl is built with the Ant tool, so you'll need that in order to
   build Hecl.

2) To compile the J2SE version of Hecl, do this:

   ant packageCommandline

3) At this point, you have a Hecl.jar file in the directory
   jars/j2se/Hecl.jar

   java -jar jars/j2se/Hecl.jar
   hecl> puts "hello world"
hello world

4) Testing.  If you wish to test that your installation passes the
   test suite:

   java -jar jars/j2se/Hecl.jar tests/suite.hcl

   and, to get some performance numbers:

   java -jar jars/j2se/Hecl.jar tests/performance.hcl

5) Java ME versions - see docs/j2me.html

6) Android - to compile and install the Android example, do:

   ant packageAndroid

   You will need to set up android/android.properties to point the
   right place, though.
