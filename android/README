			   Hecl on Android
			   ===============

This README is the documentation for Hecl on Android.  It's not much,
but until things settle down and we begin to commit things to DocBook,
it's better than nothing.

Building Hecl
-------------

ant android-install (or android-reinstall) builds Hecl and sends it to
the running Android emulator.

Editing the script
------------------

The package that gets sent to the emulator resides in
android/bin/Hecl.apk, and is basically a .zip file.  This means that
it's possible to modify the Hecl script contained therein and
repackage the .apk without recompiling anything:

# Go to the android directory.
cd android/
# Replace the script.hcl file in Hecl.apk with our modifications.
zip -r bin/Hecl.apk res/raw/script.hcl
# Send it to the emulator.
/opt/android_sdk_linux_m3-rc22a/tools/adb install bin/Hecl.apk

With the Hecl script executed being res/raw/script.hcl.

Android Hecl Commands
---------------------

Read script.hcl to get an idea of what's going on.  If you don't like
some aspect of how it works, now's the time to say something!  In
order to get something working, I created some reflection code for
Hecl, so most of the commands are, in reality, closely related to the
Java classes and methods documented here:
