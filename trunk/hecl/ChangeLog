2004-12-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/CodeThing.java: Added more doc strings.

	* tests/parse.hcl: New test file for odd parse tests.  Added test
	to check for command names in variables, which currently doesn't
	work.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: Got rid of appendCurrent, as I do
	not think it is really necessary.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Fixed up some of the documentation
	strings.

2004-11-22  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: Added ; as command terminator.

2004-11-20  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* j2me/ : Added various other bits and pieces of the Hecl.jar
	example for j2me devices, namely Hecl.jar, Hecl.jad, and a small
	README.

	* j2me/FormAppendCmd.java: Added this command, which is just used
	by the MIDHecl example.

	* j2me/MIDHecl.java: Added midlet example.

2004-11-18  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Interp.java: Added stackPush method in order to
	be able to implement upeval, but it's a temporary solution.  We
	need to be able to pick specific levels to upeval at.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/UpCmd.java: Added java to implement upeval
	command.

2004-11-14  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Get String out of StringBuffer,
	because j2me can't append stringbuffers to stringbuffers.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ParseList.java: Use direct character comparison
	(ch == ' ', etc...)  instead of isWhitespace to determine if the
	character is white space or not.  Need this for J2ME.

	* Makefile (hecl.jar): Added two inner class .class files
	manually, as the filenames do not correspond to any .java files.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Load.java: Made 'Load' into an interface - use
	'abstract' to make j2me happy.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Command.java: Added 'abstract' to interface -
	apparently j2me stuff needs it.  Weird.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Use addElement instead of add.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: Use addElement instead of add.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/IntrospectCmd.java: Use addElement instead of add.

2004-11-13  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* Makefile: Significant cleanup that makes things much smoother.

2004-11-09  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* Added license text to files.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Interp.java: It is now necessary to pass an
	instance of a Load derived object to the Interp being created, so
	that it has at least one way of loading external resources.

	* A few more documentation comments.

2004-11-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/catch.hcl: We no longer require bad commands to report
	their name.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Added CODE, GROUP and SUBST types.
	I'm not entirely happy with CODE and SUBST, because things
	external to 'Thing' need to know about them.  We may rejig this
	soon.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: New method to parse a string into a
	CodeThing object.  Use GROUP type objects for aggregations of
	text/code.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Eval.java: Most of the eval logic is now in
	CodeThing.  Eval just takes care of doing the parse, if it's
	needed.

	* RLHecl.java: Added Readline lib support.  We need to make this
	use Editline, I guess, because I don't want to GPL Hecl.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/CodeThing.java: Added CodeThing class to take
	care of 'code' type objects.

2004-10-30  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ForCmd.java: Added "for" command code.

	* tests/for.hcl: Added "for" test.

2004-10-28  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ListCmd.java: lindex now uses negative elements
	to start from the end of the list.  Added lset and linsert
	commands.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/JoinSplitCmd.java: Break join and split out
	into their own file.

	* tests/append.hcl: append now uses references instead of the
	variable name.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Removed appendString methods in
	favor of a method that returns a stringbuffer that may be operated
	on directly.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ParseList.java: Use toStringBuffer and the
	resulting stringbuffer to append to the Thing that is the result
	of parsing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: Use toStringBuffer and the
	resulting stringbuffer to append to the Thing that is the result
	of parsing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/IncrCmd.java: Use setInt API of Thing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/AppendCmd.java: Use the toStringBuffer API of
	Thing.

2004-10-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Proc.java: procs now give errors with the wrong
	number of arguments.

2004-10-24  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/CatchCmd.java: No longer catch Exception's.
	Eval should catch them and pass them on as HeclExceptions.

2004-09-17  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* HeclThing.java: Added toListString method in order to print
	sublists separately.

2004-09-15  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* Hecl.java: Started changelog.
