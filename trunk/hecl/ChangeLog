2008-02-08  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Changed the way we pass
	things around in heclTypeToJavaType and mapParams: since we could
	legitimately be returning 'null', we utilize a one-element array
	to stash a return value in.  This fixes a problem we had with
	accepting null values.

	* java/org/hecl/java/NullCmd.java: Added separate null command here.

	* commandline/Hecl.java: Add in [null] command.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Move the [null]
	command from here into the java/ package.

	* android/AndroidManifest.xml: Give Hecl XMPP permissions.

2008-02-06  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added interactive server.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/HeclHandler.java: added initial
	Handler to handle messages passed around between threads.

2008-02-03  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Added constructors method to
	return a list of types that can be passed to create a new object
	of this type.

	* java/org/hecl/java/JavaCmd.java: Added -constructors subcommand.

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added a simple Hecl server that can
	be accessed from outside via telnet.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Load base64 stuff by
	default.

2008-01-31  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/StringCmds.java: Added strreplace command.

	* tests/string.hcl: Added strreplace command tests.

2008-01-26  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Extracted hecl to java
	method, which is used in multiple places.

	* tests/java.hcl: Added some tests to make sure that
	getting/setting fields works, and throws an error when it doesn't.

	* java/org/hecl/java/JavaCmd.java: -field, with two arguments, now
	can set the field as well.

2008-01-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Centralized the
	transformation of Java objects into Hecl Things.

2008-01-22  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/threads.hcl: Added a test to poke and prod the
	synchronization of the Interp.eval method.

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Use sub-activities for new screens.

	* tests/performance.hcl: Run the bubble sort performance test too.

	* tests/sort-performance.hcl: Added bubblesort performance test.
	Thanks to Celso Pinto <hecl@7syntax.com>.

2008-01-15  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* docs/hecl.xml: Reworked the installation/tools portion of the
	document, including a quick set of instructions of how to make
	Eclipse work with Hecl scripts, by Martin Mainusch
	<DONUS@gmx.net>.  Also redid some of the section on hacking the
	Hecl Java ME code.

	* jars/: Rearranged the Java ME jars.

2008-01-11  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Don't load methodnames until
	it's actually necessary.  This also speeds the load time.

	* android/android.properties: Added properties file so that people
	will have something to modify.

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added java integration commands as
	needed.  This speeds the loading time, because the Hecl/Java
	integrations are only done when they're needed.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Removed a number
	of commands, which can be loaded on an as-needed basis in order to
	speed up loading time.

2008-01-10  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* settings.xml: Set an android flag in the build symbols.

	* tests/circular.hcl: Comment out test that crashes the test suite
	for the time being.

	* android/res/raw/lib.hcl: Added newActivity proc to create new
	SubHecl activities.

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added some things to deal with the
	Script provider, and create new activities.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Made interp static so
	that other things bundled with Hecl can access it, such as
	SubHecl.  Make sure to set the correct hecl instance in AndroidCmd
	on resume.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Added intent
	command.  Changed 'log' command to androidlog so as to not
	conflict with the math operation log.

	* android/AndroidManifest.xml: Added ScriptProvider.

	* net/org/hecl/HttpCmd.java: We no longer need to pass the Interp
	to HttpRequest.

	* net/org/hecl/HttpRequest.java: *For the moment*, don't do the
	synchronized notify of the Interp object, as this conflicts with
	the synchronized version of Interp's eval method.  As a
	consequence, we also eliminate references to the object to
	synchronize on.

2008-01-08  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/HeclTask.java: Print stack trace even for 'normal'
	exceptions.

	* midp20gui/org/hecl/midp20/lcdui/ChoiceGroupCmd.java: Make sure
	that the user doesn't try and create the ChoiceGroup as implicit.

	* core/org/hecl/Properties.java: Make sure that properties are
	even-numbered.

2008-01-07  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* applet/org/hecl/applet/HeclApplet.java: Add in Hecl java
	command, print stack traces on errors.

2008-01-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/suite.hcl: Added http.hcl.

	* tests/http.hcl: Test http command.  Ideally this wouldn't run if
	we're not connected to the internet.

2008-01-02  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Added fancier commandline completion
	system that completes first on the available command names, and
	subsequently on available variable names.
