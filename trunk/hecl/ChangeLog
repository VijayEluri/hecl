	* com/dedasys/hecl/Interp.java: It is now necessary to pass an
	instance of a Load derived object to the Interp being created, so
	that it has at least one way of loading external resources.

	* A few more documentation comments.

2004-11-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/catch.hcl: We no longer require bad commands to report
	their name.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Added CODE, GROUP and SUBST types.
	I'm not entirely happy with CODE and SUBST, because things
	external to 'Thing' need to know about them.  We may rejig this
	soon.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: New method to parse a string into a
	CodeThing object.  Use GROUP type objects for aggregations of
	text/code.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Eval.java: Most of the eval logic is now in
	CodeThing.  Eval just takes care of doing the parse, if it's
	needed.

	* RLHecl.java: Added Readline lib support.  We need to make this
	use Editline, I guess, because I don't want to GPL Hecl.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/CodeThing.java: Added CodeThing class to take
	care of 'code' type objects.

2004-10-30  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ForCmd.java: Added "for" command code.

	* tests/for.hcl: Added "for" test.

2004-10-28  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ListCmd.java: lindex now uses negative elements
	to start from the end of the list.  Added lset and linsert
	commands.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/JoinSplitCmd.java: Break join and split out
	into their own file.

	* tests/append.hcl: append now uses references instead of the
	variable name.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Removed appendString methods in
	favor of a method that returns a stringbuffer that may be operated
	on directly.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ParseList.java: Use toStringBuffer and the
	resulting stringbuffer to append to the Thing that is the result
	of parsing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: Use toStringBuffer and the
	resulting stringbuffer to append to the Thing that is the result
	of parsing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/IncrCmd.java: Use setInt API of Thing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/AppendCmd.java: Use the toStringBuffer API of
	Thing.

2004-10-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Proc.java: procs now give errors with the wrong
	number of arguments.

2004-10-24  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/CatchCmd.java: No longer catch Exception's.
	Eval should catch them and pass them on as HeclExceptions.

2004-09-17  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* HeclThing.java: Added toListString method in order to print
	sublists separately.

2004-09-15  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* Hecl.java: Started changelog.
