	* core/org/hecl/InterpCmds.java: Added a "thisinterp" command for
	the J2SE version, which returns an ObjectThing with the current
	interprter in it.  Also fixed the after command to return a handle
	to the event.

	and menucallback commands in favor of public fields of the Hecl
	class.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Removed menu junk in
	favor of two callbacks for menus.

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added MenuSetup proc with new menu
	view source command.

	* core/org/hecl/SubstThing.java: Removed code utilizing the
	literal flag, as this is entirely covered in Interp's setVar
	method.

	* core/org/hecl/Thing.java: setCopyVal won't copy into literals,
	either.

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java: Set literal bit for all things created
	in the parser.

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: addTimer isn't synchronized any more
	- we synchronize on the timers object instead.  setVar: if the
	value is literal, make a deepcopy of it.

	* core/org/hecl/Stanza.java: Don't automatically set copy flag -
	it's not needed.

	* core/org/hecl/SubstThing.java: Added code to handle literal
	Things.

	* core/org/hecl/PrintThing.java: Print out the literal flag in
	addition to the copy flag.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Added refcount scheme
	for creating new interpreters so as to avoid doing this in SubHecl
	instances.

	* androidbuilder/org/hecl/androidbuilder/AndroidBuilder.java:
	Added permissions flag to set permissions in the
	AndroidManifest.xml file.  Tweaked icon stuff to use a name that
	works (fingers crossed).  Move resulting file into current working
	directory.

2008-03-04  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* androidbuilder/org/hecl/androidbuilder/AndroidBuilder.java:
	Added a few more comments, command line options.

	* android/build.xml: Make a jar and then create the dex files from
	that.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Use a boolean to protect
	the interp creation code that should only be run once, instead of
	ugly class based code.  Added a createCommands method that gets
	overridden by facade classes created by AndroidBuilder.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Moved hecl and
	subhecl command creation to Hecl.java itself, so that they can be
	subclassed by made up classes created by AndroidBuilder.

	Beginnings of a tool to be utilized for creating Hecl Android
	applications.

2008-02-28  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	extra copies of cmdline.

	name), to post code back to the main thread.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Added stubs for onStop
	and onDestroy.  I suppose we could do callbacks here.

	* android/AndroidManifest.xml: Added ACCESS_LOCATION and
	ACCESS_GPS permissions.

	* docs/hecl.xml: Corrected path for Hecl jar.  Updated to WTK 2.5.2.

2008-02-18  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	Toast's instead of Notifications.

	reworking to update to M5.

	* android/AndroidManifest.xml: Updated to M5.

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Check first for null Hecl
	objects, as these can match any Java object.

	* tests/java.hcl: Added test for null parameter.

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Changed the way we pass
	things around in heclTypeToJavaType and mapParams: since we could
	legitimately be returning 'null', we utilize a one-element array
	to stash a return value in.  This fixes a problem we had with
	accepting null values.

	* java/org/hecl/java/NullCmd.java: Added separate null command here.

	* commandline/Hecl.java: Add in [null] command.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Move the [null]
	command from here into the java/ package.

	method, which is used in multiple places.

	* tests/java.hcl: Added some tests to make sure that
	getting/setting fields works, and throws an error when it doesn't.

	* java/org/hecl/java/JavaCmd.java: -field, with two arguments, now
	can set the field as well.

2008-01-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* docs/hecl.xml: Reworked the installation/tools portion of the
	document, including a quick set of instructions of how to make
	Eclipse work with Hecl scripts, by Martin Mainusch
	<DONUS@gmx.net>.  Also redid some of the section on hacking the
	Hecl Java ME code.

	* jars/: Rearranged the Java ME jars.

2008-01-11  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* java/org/hecl/java/Reflector.java: Don't load methodnames until
	it's actually necessary.  This also speeds the load time.

	* android/android.properties: Added properties file so that people
	will have something to modify.

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added java integration commands as
	needed.  This speeds the loading time, because the Hecl/Java
	integrations are only done when they're needed.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Removed a number
	of commands, which can be loaded on an as-needed basis in order to
	speed up loading time.

2008-01-10  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* settings.xml: Set an android flag in the build symbols.

	* tests/circular.hcl: Comment out test that crashes the test suite
	for the time being.

	* android/res/raw/lib.hcl: Added newActivity proc to create new
	SubHecl activities.

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added some things to deal with the
	Script provider, and create new activities.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Made interp static so
	that other things bundled with Hecl can access it, such as
	SubHecl.  Make sure to set the correct hecl instance in AndroidCmd
	on resume.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Added intent
	command.  Changed 'log' command to androidlog so as to not
	conflict with the math operation log.

	* android/AndroidManifest.xml: Added ScriptProvider.

	* net/org/hecl/HttpCmd.java: We no longer need to pass the Interp
	to HttpRequest.

	* net/org/hecl/HttpRequest.java: *For the moment*, don't do the
	synchronized notify of the Interp object, as this conflicts with
	the synchronized version of Interp's eval method.  As a
	consequence, we also eliminate references to the object to
	synchronize on.

2008-01-08  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/HeclTask.java: Print stack trace even for 'normal'

	even-numbered.

	command, print stack traces on errors.

2008-01-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/suite.hcl: Added http.hcl.

	* tests/http.hcl: Test http command.  Ideally this wouldn't run if
	we're not connected to the internet.

2008-01-02  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Added fancier commandline completion
	system that completes first on the available command names, and
	subsequently on available variable names.
