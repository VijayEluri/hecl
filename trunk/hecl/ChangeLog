	* float/org/hecl/BasicMathCmd.java: Throw the exceptions, adjusted
	numbers of required arguments.

	* core/org/hecl/ProcCmd.java: Throw an exception for the wrong
	number of arguments.

2006-01-11  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/proc.hcl: Test to make sure the fix to Stanza.java below
	works.

	* core/org/hecl/Stanza.java: Fixed bug caught by Wolfgang Kechel.
	If a stanza's argv[0] is something that gets substituted, it
	shouldn't be saved, so we don't.

2006-01-10  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Properties.java: Added two functions, delProp and
	getProps for Wolfgang Kechel's new Hecl J2ME UI.

2006-01-08  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: ChoiceGroups and Listboxes now operate with a
	list of indices for elements that are on or off.  For instance,
	setprop &choicegroup {1 5} turns on elements 1 and 5 (if the
	ChoiceGroup is not exclusive).

2006-01-04  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* HeclBuilder/heclbuilder/HeclEditor.java: Rudimentary file
	viewer/editor.  You should really just use something with a decent
	Tcl editing mode for the time being.

	* HeclBuilder/heclbuilder/HeclBuilderGui.java: Added mini-IDE to
	be used for the creation of J2ME apps.

2006-01-03  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* jarhack/jarhack/JarHack.java: This code takes a .jar file and
	transforms it into a new .jar file with a modified MANIFEST.MF
	file, in order to be able to put multiple Hecl applications on a
	phone without recompiling them.

	* build.xml: Added instructions to build JarHack.

2005-12-26  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java: Added some code from Wolfgang
	S. Kechel <wolfgang.kechel@data2c.com> that improves the parser,
	allowing it to handle more punctuation.

2005-11-30  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* build.xml: Added the necessary build instructions for record
	stores.

	* j2me/Hecl.java: Added recordstore module.

	* rms/org/hecl/rms/HeclRecordStoreCmd.java: Implemented three very
	simply recordstore commands: rs_list, which lists all the
	recordstores available, rs_get, which fetches a names recordstore
	as a Thing, and rs_put, which puts a Thing into a named
	RecordStore.

	* rms/org/hecl/rms/RMSModule.java: Module for RecordStore.

2005-11-28  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* build.xml: Added a few things to build http_micro cleanly into
	the j2me version.

2005-11-22  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Thanks to a suggestion by Kevin Kenny, we
	simply divide by 1000 to get a number we can use when we get a
	"datefield"'s date, and then multiply by 1000 when we set.  We
	lose out on some granularity, but frankly I think we can live with
	it.  The alternative might be to implement the Double stuff in the
	core, with the understanding that it uses longs by default and
	real doubles only in the j2se version.  That sounds confusing and
	is likely to be confusing.

2005-11-13  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Added a getTextType method in order to be
	able to do 'type numeric' for textboxes and texfields.

2005-11-07  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* j2me/Hecl.java: Build the http module in.

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Now implements ItemStateListener so that we
	can listen for changes to form items.  Added 'datefield' command.
	Run Commands in new threads.  I think this should eventually be
	moved to one extra thread with a queue, but this'll do for now.

	* core/org/hecl/Properties.java: Added existsProp method to
	determine if a property exists or not.

2005-11-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* Various little fixes to eliminate compile time warnings.

	* build.xml: Add preverify step so that we can compile with older
	javac's.

2005-11-02  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Added 'alert' command. Added 'changegroup'
	command.
	(get/setindex): Make these commands work on Choice's instead of
	Lists or ChoiceGroups in particular.
	(listbox): This command now accepts a 'list' argument like
	choicegroup.  This ends up making code more compact and immediate.
	Added 'gauge' command.

2005-10-21  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* j2me/script.hcl: Squeezed 'script' into 900 characters, the max
	size for TextBox's on my Nokia phone.

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Catch errors generated when putting too much
	text into TextBoxes.

	* j2me/Hecl.java: Added "splash" screen.

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Major changes: Use a Properties class instead
	of our own hashtable for properties.  Add 'List' widgets - you can
	get the list of selected elements via the selected property.
	Added setindex and getindex commands to fetch or change the item
	or string (where possible) at a given index in a form or list.
	Added 'noscreen' command which evaluates some code without a
	screen present.  This is necessary for the getindex and setindex
	commands, because most other commands use the currently set
	screen.

	* core/org/hecl/CodeThing.java: Change lists into codethings
	without an intermediate string step.

2005-10-20  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/FilterCmd.java: Make sure to copy elements so as
	to not modify them.

	* core/org/hecl/ForeachCmd.java: Make sure to copy elements so as
	not to modify them.

2005-10-19  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/HashThing.java: If a HashThing is slated for
	copying, its elements should be as well.

	* core/org/hecl/ListThing.java: If a ListThing is slated for
	copying, its elements should be as well.

	* core/org/hecl/ParseList.java: Add escape ("\\") parsing to
	ParseList.java.

	* core/org/hecl/Stanza.java: Copy on write for GroupThings as
	well.

2005-10-18  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/EqualsCmd.java: Use IntThing.compare here too.

	* core/org/hecl/IntThing.java: With an eye to deprecating
	Compare.java, moved compareInt to compare in IntThing.

	* float/org/hecl/EqualsCmd.java: Created version of this file that
	is FP enabled.

	* commandline/StandaloneHecl.java: Use the FP stuff in the
	Standalone jar.

	* build.xml: Fixed a few things for the Standalone build.

2005-10-17  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Compare.java: Added a compareProc method that
	takes an interp and a proc, and runs the proc with the two values
	to perform the comparison.

	* core/org/hecl/CodeThing.java: Changed addStanza just a bit.

	* core/org/hecl/SortCmd.java: Added int, string and proc based
	sort options.  Check for infinite loops before recursing.

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java: Let variable names contain numbers as
	long as it's not the first character.

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Added a few more get/set prop option
	implementations.  Don't try and modify the widget if it doesn't
	exist!

2005-10-15  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* build.xml: Make jdocs for all the packages.

	* float/org/hecl/IntThing.java: This version of IntThing knows
	about doubles, so that it can transform DoubleThings into
	IntThings without going through the string representation.

	* float/org/hecl/FloatCmd.java: Initial commit of commands that
	make use of floating point numbers, for now, "round".

	* float/org/hecl/BasicMathCmd.java: Double enabled version of
	basic math commands.

	* float/org/hecl/DoubleThing.java: DoubleThing type to handle
	large and/or floating point numbers.  This resides in its own
	directory so that it's possible to include it separately.

2005-10-13  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* applet/org/hecl/applet/HeclApplet.java: Fixed up the applet
	some... monospace font, execute the hecl code itself in a thread,
	and a few other details.

2005-10-12  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* docs/hecl.xml: Added and, not and or to the docs.

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Added J2ME-specific 'exit' command.

	* docs/hecl.xml: Added some tutorial-like information on creating
	Hecl J2ME applications.

	* core/org/hecl/GlobalCmd.java: If the variable already exists and
	it needs copying, do so, so as not to run into problems when
	someone else sets it and the local and global versions get out of
	sync.

	* core/org/hecl/SubstThing.java: We check to see if the Thing in
	question is slated for copying, and do so if it is.

	* core/org/hecl/ExitCmd.java: Added "exit" command.

	* build.xml: Added updatejad.hcl file to update the .jad file with
	the correct file size.

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java, Stanza.java, Thing.java: Implemented
	a sort of copy on write for Things, so that we don't change
	"literals" (for example: set foo ""; append &foo "bar"; ), but
	references still work.

2005-10-11  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Added default text for stringitems.

	* core/org/hecl/LogicCmd.java: Added some basic logic commands,
	'and', 'not' and 'or'.

	* docs/hecl.xml: Added some new commands to the documentation.

	* core/org/hecl/Thing.java: Make getStringRep do the same thing as
	toString.  I think it may be possible to simply get rid of
	getStringRep in favor of the more java-ish toString.

2005-10-10  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* files/org/hecl/files/HeclFile.java: Make the default file be "".

2005-10-09  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* docs/hecl.xml: Updated docs regarding Hecl/Java integration.

	* build.xml: Fixed up J2ME build system.

	* j2me/Makefile: Removed.

2005-10-08  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/parse.hcl: New tests to check escape parsing.

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java: Parser fix: make sure that a \ that is
	on its own (after a whitespace) still quotes the character after
	it.  Added an escape parser so that it is possible to add unicode
	sequences, newlines, and tabs.

	* modules/org/hecl/modules/HeclModule.java: Perhaps we could
	simply put this file elsewhere, because it seems a waste of
	resources to just leave it empty here, all by its lonesome.

	* http/org/hecl/http/HttpModule.java: Implement HeclModule.

	* files/org/hecl/files/HeclFile.java: Added writeFile method to
	dump entire file at once.

	* core/org/hecl/Compare.java: When comparing the string
	representation of two things, we don't want to use
	StringThing.get(), because that transforms the object in question
	into an actual string!

	* commandline/Hecl.java: Module initialization can't be static
	methods anymore.

2005-10-07  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* build.xml: Added modules, load classpaths.  A variety of
	subsystems, such as compileFiles, now depend on modules, and this
	is hopefully reflected throughout the build system.  Added a
	'jfreechart' bit that's only really of use to me right now.
	packageCommandline no longer includes http_standard by default,
	since it's now possible to load the code dynamically!

	* files/org/hecl/files/ReadCmd.java: Added a 'readall' command
	that slurps in an entire file.

	* files/org/hecl/files/WriteCmd.java: Added a 'write' command.

	* load/org/hecl/load/HeclLoad.java: The module portion of the load
	system.

	* load/org/hecl/load/LoadCmd.java: Implement the 'load' command.
	For the moment, we use java.net.URLClassLoader to do the dirty
	work, as this keeps Hecl smaller and lets us use existing code.

2005-10-06  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* j2me/script.hcl: Broke script out into a separate file.

	* j2me/Hecl.java: Use external resource file so that we can just
	use jar to create new Hecl apps!

2005-10-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Compare.java: Do non-destructive comparisons.

2005-10-03  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* build.xml: Get rid of the pjava stuff.  We can add it back in
	later if there are any modules that are specific to that platform.

2005-10-02  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* Updated j2me readme, added in some jdocs files that were
	missing.

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: New, updated commands that all use a list of
	properties to govern their behavior: form, textbox, stringitem,
	string, cmd, textfield, plus getprop, setprop and setcurrent.

	* j2me/Hecl.java: Massive reworking based on new gui commands.
	Hecl demo is now written in Hecl!

2005-09-23  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/parse.hcl (parse-7): Add test for parsing change.

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java: the ';' character is ok immediately
	after a right brace, too.

	* j2me/Hecl.java: Much more sophisticated demo with gui elements.

	* j2me/GUICmds.java: Initial GUI commands.

	* core/org/hecl/: Removed Module and Resource related files.

	* pjava: Removed files here as the related functionality is now in
	the files/ directory.

	* core/org/hecl/IntrospectCmd.java: Removed 'modules' subcommand -
	this will have to go elsewhere.

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Ripped out the module and resource
	code.  The modules code can be readded in in the modules/
	directory and the compiled in as desired, but it's better as
	something external to the core for those who know exactly what
	they want to compile in and prefer to keep things reduced to the
	bare minimum.

	* http_micro/org/hecl/http/HttpRequest.java: This is where the
	j2me http request code resides.  It's compiled together with the
	http/ code to produce the http library for j2me.

	* files/org/hecl/files/HeclFile.java: Added a collection of file
	commands - 'cd', 'filetolist', 'listtofile' and 'source'.

	* build.xml: Added 'files' package, and split the http into
	standard and j2me builds.

	* tests/path.hcl: Added some tests for path commands.

	* docs/hecl.xml: Added lrange command documentation.

2005-09-17  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/ListCmd.java: Added lrange command.

2005-08-24  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/deepcopy.hcl: Added tests to determine whether deep
	copying is working or not.

	* core/org/hecl/Stanza.java: Added deepcopy method.

	* core/org/hecl/CodeThing.java: Added real deepcopy method.

2005-08-16  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* docs/hecl.xml: Added '=', '!=' and 'ne' documentation.

	* core/org/hecl/EqualsCmd.java: Added != and ne commands from
	David Baker <david.baker@akain.com>.

	* tests/global.hcl (twoglobals): Test for 'global' with multiple
	variable names.

	* core/org/hecl/GlobalCmd.java: The 'global' command now accepts
	multiple variable names.

	* tests/math.hcl: Test for '+' that accepts multiple arguments.

	* core/org/hecl/BasicMathCmd.java: Now it's possible to add more
	than one number: set six [+ 1 2 3].

2005-08-07  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* docs/jdocs/: Updated javadocs.

	* build.xml: Added 'docs' build target.  Ant syntax is very, very
	verbose.

	* tests/sort.hcl: Add test for empty list.

	* core/org/hecl/SortCmd.java: Test for 0 length lists.

2005-06-11  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* commandline/Hecl.java: Throw away empty strings, don't report
	them back to the user.

	* core/org/hecl/Compare.java: Make this class public.

2005-06-07  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Stanza.java: Cancel out interp.result each time
	through.

	* tests/return.hcl (emptyreturn): Test for return values that
	'stick around' longer than they are welcome to.

2005-05-26  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/ClassThing.java: Removed, for now.

	* commandline/Hecl.java: Print interp.result for each command when
	in interactive mode.

2005-05-24  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/sort.hcl: Sorting numbers always does an integer sort now.

	* http/org/hecl/http/HeclModule.java: Use Interp.commands
	directly.

	* core/org/hecl/Thing.java: Removed compare method in favore of
	Compare class.  toString method no longer throws HeclException.

	* core/org/hecl/Stanza.java: Automatically fall through in case
	statement for small space savings.

	* core/org/hecl/RealThing.java: getStringRep doesn't throw a
	HeclException.

	* core/org/hecl/ProcCmd.java: Reworked for small space savings,
	and to utilize Interp.commands directly.

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java: Reworked things a bit to save some
	space.

	* core/org/hecl/ListThing.java: Removed IntThing shortcut.
	Removed various HeclExceptions from functions to transform lists
	to strings.

	* core/org/hecl/IntrospectCmd.java: Use Interp.commands.put
	directly instead of accessor functions.

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Use commands.put directly instead of
	accessor functions.  Cut that extra bit of fat out.

	* core/org/hecl/HeclException.java: Rejig things to save a few
	bytes.

	* core/org/hecl/HashThing.java: Don't throw exceptions from
	getStringRep.

	* core/org/hecl/GroupThing.java: Don't throw exceptions from
	getStringRep.

	* core/org/hecl/Compare.java: Lose some of the HeclExceptions.

	* applet/org/hecl/applet/HeclApplet.java: Work with commands hash
	table directly.

	for space savings.

	* docs/hecl.xml: Added short section on installation.

	* build.xml: Added Main-Class entry to Jar file so that it can be
	run from the command line.

2005-03-23  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Parse.java: Make sure that {} blocks cannot be
	followed by extra characters.

	* core/org/hecl/Thing.java: Check for nesting depth in deepcopy,
	so that circular list references don't bite us...

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: MODULE_CLASS_PACKAGE now uses the
	right name.

	* build.xml: Added compile instructions for "pjava".

2005-03-17  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* docs/hecl.xml: Fixed 'search' description.

2005-03-15  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* build.xml: Added compileCommandline and packageCommandline
	targets.  This last one creates a Hecl.jar that can be run with a
	normal Java system.

	* commandline/Hecl.java: Added a command line interpreter.  Some
	features like determining whether a command is complete or not
	would still be handy.

	* Large rework of the code and build process.

2005-03-09  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	IntThing.

	command.

2004-11-14  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Get String out of StringBuffer,
	because j2me can't append stringbuffers to stringbuffers.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ParseList.java: Use direct character comparison
	(ch == ' ', etc...)  instead of isWhitespace to determine if the
	character is white space or not.  Need this for J2ME.

	* Makefile (hecl.jar): Added two inner class .class files
	manually, as the filenames do not correspond to any .java files.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Load.java: Made 'Load' into an interface - use
	'abstract' to make j2me happy.

	apparently j2me stuff needs it.  Weird.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Use addElement instead of add.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: Use addElement instead of add.

	instance of a Load derived object to the Interp being created, so
	that it has at least one way of loading external resources.

	* A few more documentation comments.

2004-11-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/catch.hcl: We no longer require bad commands to report
	their name.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Added CODE, GROUP and SUBST types.
	I'm not entirely happy with CODE and SUBST, because things
	external to 'Thing' need to know about them.  We may rejig this
	soon.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: New method to parse a string into a
	CodeThing object.  Use GROUP type objects for aggregations of
	text/code.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Eval.java: Most of the eval logic is now in
	CodeThing.  Eval just takes care of doing the parse, if it's
	needed.

	* RLHecl.java: Added Readline lib support.  We need to make this
	use Editline, I guess, because I don't want to GPL Hecl.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/CodeThing.java: Added CodeThing class to take
	care of 'code' type objects.

2004-10-30  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ForCmd.java: Added "for" command code.

	commands.

	into their own file.

	* tests/append.hcl: append now uses references instead of the
	variable name.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Removed appendString methods in
	favor of a method that returns a stringbuffer that may be operated
	on directly.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ParseList.java: Use toStringBuffer and the
	resulting stringbuffer to append to the Thing that is the result
	of parsing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: Use toStringBuffer and the
	resulting stringbuffer to append to the Thing that is the result
	of parsing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/IncrCmd.java: Use setInt API of Thing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/AppendCmd.java: Use the toStringBuffer API of
	Thing.

2004-10-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	number of arguments.

2004-10-24  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/CatchCmd.java: No longer catch Exception's.
	Eval should catch them and pass them on as HeclExceptions.

2004-09-17  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* HeclThing.java: Added toListString method in order to print
	sublists separately.

2004-09-15  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* Hecl.java: Started changelog.
