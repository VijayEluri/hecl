	* net/org/hecl/HttpCmd.java: We no longer need to pass the Interp
	to HttpRequest.

	* net/org/hecl/HttpRequest.java: *For the moment*, don't do the
	synchronized notify of the Interp object, as this conflicts with
	the synchronized version of Interp's eval method.  As a
	consequence, we also eliminate references to the object to
	synchronize on.

	* core/org/hecl/HeclTask.java: Print stack trace even for 'normal'
	exceptions.

	* midp20gui/org/hecl/midp20/lcdui/ChoiceGroupCmd.java: Make sure
	that the user doesn't try and create the ChoiceGroup as implicit.

	* core/org/hecl/Properties.java: Make sure that properties are
	even-numbered.

	* applet/org/hecl/applet/HeclApplet.java: Add in Hecl java
	command, print stack traces on errors.

	* tests/suite.hcl: Added http.hcl.

	* tests/http.hcl: Test http command.  Ideally this wouldn't run if
	we're not connected to the internet.

2008-01-02  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Added fancier commandline completion
	system that completes first on the available command names, and
	subsequently on available variable names.
