	* settings.xml: Set an android flag in the build symbols.

	* tests/circular.hcl: Comment out test that crashes the test suite
	for the time being.

	* android/res/raw/lib.hcl: Added newActivity proc to create new
	SubHecl activities.

	* android/res/raw/script.hcl: Added some things to deal with the
	Script provider, and create new activities.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/Hecl.java: Made interp static so
	that other things bundled with Hecl can access it, such as
	SubHecl.  Make sure to set the correct hecl instance in AndroidCmd
	on resume.

	* android/src/org/hecl/android/AndroidCmd.java: Added intent
	command.  Changed 'log' command to androidlog so as to not
	conflict with the math operation log.

	* android/AndroidManifest.xml: Added ScriptProvider.

	* net/org/hecl/HttpCmd.java: We no longer need to pass the Interp
	to HttpRequest.

	* net/org/hecl/HttpRequest.java: *For the moment*, don't do the
	synchronized notify of the Interp object, as this conflicts with
	the synchronized version of Interp's eval method.  As a
	consequence, we also eliminate references to the object to
	synchronize on.

	* core/org/hecl/HeclTask.java: Print stack trace even for 'normal'
	exceptions.

	* midp20gui/org/hecl/midp20/lcdui/ChoiceGroupCmd.java: Make sure
	that the user doesn't try and create the ChoiceGroup as implicit.

	* core/org/hecl/Properties.java: Make sure that properties are
	even-numbered.

	* applet/org/hecl/applet/HeclApplet.java: Add in Hecl java
	command, print stack traces on errors.

2008-01-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/suite.hcl: Added http.hcl.

	* tests/http.hcl: Test http command.  Ideally this wouldn't run if
	we're not connected to the internet.

2008-01-02  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Added fancier commandline completion
	system that completes first on the available command names, and
	subsequently on available variable names.
