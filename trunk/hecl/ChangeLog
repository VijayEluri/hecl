	* core/org/hecl/IntrospectCmd.java: Removed 'modules' subcommand -
	this will have to go elsewhere.

	* core/org/hecl/Interp.java: Ripped out the module and resource
	code.  The modules code can be readded in in the modules/
	directory and the compiled in as desired, but it's better as
	something external to the core for those who know exactly what
	they want to compile in and prefer to keep things reduced to the
	bare minimum.

	* http_micro/org/hecl/http/HttpRequest.java: This is where the
	j2me http request code resides.  It's compiled together with the
	http/ code to produce the http library for j2me.

	command.

2004-11-14  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	because j2me can't append stringbuffers to stringbuffers.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ParseList.java: Use direct character comparison
	(ch == ' ', etc...)  instead of isWhitespace to determine if the
	character is white space or not.  Need this for J2ME.

	* Makefile (hecl.jar): Added two inner class .class files
	manually, as the filenames do not correspond to any .java files.

2004-11-05  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/catch.hcl: We no longer require bad commands to report
	their name.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Added CODE, GROUP and SUBST types.
	I'm not entirely happy with CODE and SUBST, because things
	external to 'Thing' need to know about them.  We may rejig this
	soon.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: New method to parse a string into a
	CodeThing object.  Use GROUP type objects for aggregations of
	text/code.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Eval.java: Most of the eval logic is now in
	CodeThing.  Eval just takes care of doing the parse, if it's
	needed.

	* RLHecl.java: Added Readline lib support.  We need to make this
	use Editline, I guess, because I don't want to GPL Hecl.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/CodeThing.java: Added CodeThing class to take
	care of 'code' type objects.

2004-10-30  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	commands.

	into their own file.

	* tests/append.hcl: append now uses references instead of the
	variable name.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Thing.java: Removed appendString methods in
	favor of a method that returns a stringbuffer that may be operated
	on directly.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/ParseList.java: Use toStringBuffer and the
	resulting stringbuffer to append to the Thing that is the result
	of parsing.

	* com/dedasys/hecl/Parse.java: Use toStringBuffer and the
	resulting stringbuffer to append to the Thing that is the result
	of parsing.

	number of arguments.

2004-10-24  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* com/dedasys/hecl/CatchCmd.java: No longer catch Exception's.
