		      Getting Started with Hecl
		      =========================

How to compile and run simple Hecl programs.

1) Hecl is built with the Ant tool, so you'll need that in order to
   build Hecl.

2) To compile the J2SE version of Hecl, do this:

   ant packageCommandline

3) At this point, you have a Hecl.jar file in the directory
   jars/j2se/Hecl.jar

   java -jar jars/j2se/Hecl.jar
   hecl> puts "hello world"
hello world

4) If you wish, you could also compile it to native code with GCJ:

   gcj-3.4 -o hecl --main=Hecl jars/j2se/Hecl.jar

   davidw@medford:~/workshop/hecl$ ./hecl
   hecl> puts "hello world"
hello world

5) Testing.  If you wish to test that your installation passes the
   test suite:

   ./hecl tests/suite.hcl

   and, to get some performance numbers:

   ./hecl tests/performance.hcl

   or, using standard Java:

   java -jar jars/j2se/Hecl.jar tests/suite.hcl

6) J2ME Hecl.  Look at README in the j2me directory, in addition to
   the documentation in the docs/ directory.
