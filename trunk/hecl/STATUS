- syntax:
  + I'd like to have something like 'command complete' to check for
    syntactical completeness of a command.
  + multiline commands via a line continuation characters
    like '\' and '\n' in Tcl
  + fix for currently weird behavior of imcomplete commands
  + handling of numbers in input. Maybe we should better compare
    them into numbers when parsing?
  + Internationalization
    I thing the behavior of Hecl in various language environments
    is quuestionable (number formats)
- I/O
  + I'd like to have a more elaborate I/O interface, including socket
    support
  + Interfaces to phone features (bluetooth,...)

TODO:

Wolfgang:

- Enhance http (work in progress)

- provide a telnet server module to simplify testing of midlets in
  emulator (works even on a real phone but is quite slow) nearly done

- provide a jar for external midlets (wip)

- provide a new set of midp20 gui commands, at least for cldc1.1 (wip)
  This needs also some clearification concerning copyrights

- deal with multiple threads and maybe even multiple hecl interpreters
