      The Hecl Programming Language is a high-level scripting language
      implemented in Java.  It is intended to be small, extensible,
      extremely flexible, and easy to learn and use.
    </p><p>
      Why Hecl?  Hecl is intended as a complement to the Java
      programming language, not a replacement.  It tries to do well
      what Java doesn't, and leaves those tasks to Java for which it
      is best suited, by providing an API that makes it easy to tie
      the two together.  Hecl aims to be a very immediate language -
      you can pick it up and start doing useful things with it quickly
      - even people without formal training.  Hecl is easy to learn.
      Where Java is verbose and rigid, Hecl is forgiving and quick to
      write.  For instance,
      <strong class="userinput"><code>System.out.println("Hello World");</code></strong>
      vs <strong class="userinput"><code>puts "Hello World"</code></strong> - 41
      keystrokes (shifted letters count double) versus 22.  Hecl is
      built to <a href="http://www.dedasys.com/articles/scalable_systems.html" target="_top">"scale
      down"</a> - especially in terms of its users, meaning that
      it is very quick to learn, and can be quickly put to productive
      use even by those who are not programmers by trade.
    </p><p>
      This makes Hecl ideal for large applications written in Java
      that would like to provide a user friendly scripting interface,
      rather than, say, a clunky XML based system.  Examples include:
      scripted web pages, command/control logic in long running
      applications, and, I'm sure, many environments I've never
      considered.  Instead of a simple, static configuration file, you
      can give your users the power to program portions of the system
      to do things that you hadn't thought of when you wrote the
      software originally.
    </p><p>
      Hecl is a small language with a minimal core.  The idea is to
      provide only what's necessary in the language itself, and as
      needed, add in extensions for specific tasks.  Core Hecl is
      small enough to run on my Nokia 3100 cell phone as a J2ME
      application, presenting the interesting possibility of writing
      scripts, or at some point, maybe even scripting entire
      applications, for devices running embedded Java.
    </p><p>
      Contributions in the form of code, ideas, suggestions, or even
      donations are welcome.  Hecl is still growing, so your thoughts
      are important, and you can help shape the language's future.
      You can download the code via CVS from the SourceForge project
      page: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hecl/" target="_top">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hecl/</a>.
    </p><p>
      Hecl is available under the liberal Apache 2.0 open source
      license.  Which says, more or less, that you may use Hecl in
      your own applications, even if they are not open source.  You
      have to give me credit, though.  Read the license itself to
      clear up any doubts.  Oh, and incidentally, I don't see the
      license as being incompatible with the GPL, so feel free to
      utilize Hecl in your GPL product (I have added a note to this
      effect in the NOTICE file that must accompany products using the
      Hecl code).
    </p><p>
      I owe thanks to a lot of people for Hecl.  First and foremost
      the creator of the Tcl programming language, Dr. John
      Ousterhout.  While I have attempted to improve some things that
      I did not care for in Tcl, it is obvious that the simple,
      extremely flexible command-based approach that Hecl takes is
      derived from Tcl.  I also borrowed some ideas from the (mostly
      defunct) Jacl implementation of Tcl in Java.  Many thanks are
      also due my friend Salvatore Sanfilippo, with whom I have spent
      many hours discussing Hecl, Tcl, and the philosophy of
      programming languages in general.  And of course, I owe a huge
      debt of gratitude to my wife, Ilenia, who puts up with all the
      hours I spend in front of "that damn computer".
