			  J2ME Hecl Example
			  =================

This code is an example J2ME application that is written in Hecl
itself.  To build it, you need the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit:

http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/

1) From the top level directory, run 'ant packageJARs'.

2) In the j2me/ directory, run 'make'.

3) If you want to modify the Hecl code, it's in the 'script.hcl'
   file.  Type 'make' again to recreate the .jar file.

On Linux, I use gammu to upload the application to my phone:

gammu nothing --nokiaaddfile Application Hecl
