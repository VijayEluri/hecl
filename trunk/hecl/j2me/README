			  J2ME Hecl Example
			  =================

This code is an example J2ME application that is written in Hecl
itself.  To build it, you need the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit:

http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/

0) Change the <path id="j2mebootclasspath"> locations to those on your
   system.

1) From the top level directory, run 'ant packageJ2ME'.

2) If you want to modify the Hecl code, it's in the 'script.hcl'
   file.  Type 'make' again to recreate the .jar file.

On Linux, I use gammu to upload the application to my phone:

gammu nothing --nokiaaddfile Application Hecl

You can use the emulator to test out your code if you have the sun
java wireless toolkit:

~/Desktop/WTK2.2/bin/emulator -classpath Hecl.jar Hecl
